AI Study Buddy 
- Offline Learning AssistantAI Study Buddy is an Android application designed to help students learn and understand core computer science subjects. The app functions 100% offline and utilizes Machine Learning to process complex queries.
- 🚀 Key FeaturesOffline Knowledge Base:
-  Contains a dataset of 700+ technical records that works entirely without an internet connection.
-  Smart Search: Integrated with TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) to analyze and process user queries.
-  Multi-Subject Support: Specially designed for:Artificial Intelligence (AI)Machine Learning (ML)Database Systems (DBMS)Android DevelopmentHigh Performance: Utilizes HashMaps for data retrieval, ensuring high speed with $O(1)$ time complexity.
-  🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: JavaFramework: Android SDKML Engine: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite model)Data Storage: Local CSV (Parsed via BufferedReader)UI Design: XML with Material Design components📂 Project Structureassets/: Contains the StudyBuddy_Master_Dataset.csv and the 1.tflite model file.java/: Contains the backend logic, CSV parser, and HashMap management code.res/layout/: Contains the user interface and dashboard designs.
-  📖 How to UseOpen the app and select your subject from the Dashboard.Type any technical term into the chat interface (e.g., "Neural Network" or "SQL").The app will instantly display the definition and detailed explanation.
-  🧠 Intelligence Layer
-  The app goes beyond simple keyword matching; it incorporates a TFLite model to better understand user intent, allowing for more accurate and context-aware responses as the system evolves.
